# Northwind Traders Analytics

## Overview

This project performs a comprehensive analysis of the Northwind Traders dataset to uncover business insights and performance metrics. It begins with data exploration and cleaning processes, including connecting to a PostgreSQL database and performing common joins for querying. The analysis proceeds with various sections focusing on employee performance, sales trends, high-value customers, and product and category performance. Visualizations are created to illustrate trends and patterns in the data and to make data-driven recommendations.

## Dataset

The raw data was downloaded from the Northwind Traders database and loaded into a PostgreSQL database for analysis.

## Tools

- Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis
- Matplotlib: For creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations
- Seaborn: For statistical data visualization based on Matplotlib
- SQLAlchemy: For database connection and querying

## Conclusions

- Employee Performance: Focus on enhancing the performance of low-performing employees through targeted training and incentives.
- Sales Trends: Develop strategies to capitalize on months with historically high sales and investigate causes for any declines.
- High Value Customers: Implement loyalty programs and personalized marketing strategies for high-value customers to enhance customer retention.
- Product and Category: Increase marketing efforts and stock for popular product categories such as beverages, dairy products, and confections. Evaluate the performance of less popular categories and consider promotional activities to boost their sales.

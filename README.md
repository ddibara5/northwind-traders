# Northwind Traders Analytics

## Overview

This project performs a comprehensive analysis of the Northwind Traders dataset to uncover business insights and performance metrics. It begins with data exploration and cleaning processes, including connecting to a PostgreSQL database and performing common joins for querying. The analysis proceeds with various sections focusing on employee performance, sales trends, high-value customers, and product and category performance. Visualizations and statistical analysis are employed to illustrate trends and patterns in the data and to make data-driven recommendations.

## Dataset

## Tools

- Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis
- Matplotlib: For creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations

## Conclusions

- Employee Performance: Focus on enhancing the performance of low-performing employees through targeted training and incentives.
